# Litium

Litium (Lalo's Suitium) is a derivative of [JPXS' Suitium](https://github.com/jpxs-intl/Suitium).

## Lalo's Schizonotes

### Why?

Even though Suitium is projected and mostly developed by me, I never coded Suitium the way I thought was right, JPXS' Suitium follows a "Modern C++" approach, which I in fact, despair.

### And?

Litium is coded my way using C, trying to keep it simple and compatible with [Cryptic Sea](http://crypticsea.com) code. \
For people that always coded in the "~Modern~ C++" style, it might be harder to understand, but don't worry: Litium has a C++20 API wrapper.

### So?

I didn't change much my ideas of how Suitium should work for the end user and developers, which should make it easy to keep compatibility with JPXS' Suitium.
